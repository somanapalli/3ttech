   /charactersitics/buzzwords
   
   1.simple
   2.platform indepenedent
   3.architectural neutral
   4.portable
   5.object oriented
   6.robust
   7.interpreted

   goal ->to develop software/application
   
 what type of applications we have in the market?

 ->desktop applications
 ->distributed applications
 
   
  desktop application/standalone application:

it is an application in which machine
we instlled in that machine only we are able 
to consume the services.

the results of the desktop applications are 
not sharable


ex:
acroabatic reader,
antivirus,
mspaint,
calucator
 etc..

distributed application/network based application:
````````````````````````````````````````````````````
it is also an applcation which we can able to access from any where 
make sure that machine should be connected to a proper internet.

ex: facebook, gmail, yahhoo. .. etc..
 
   
   the results of the distributed applications are sharable 
   across the globe.
   
   
why should we learn core java or significance of learning core java?


->using core java knowledge, we are able to develop standalone
  applications/desktop applications.

->using core java knowledge,we  are able to learn advaned java

->to learn high end tools like salesforce, pega,bigdata, mulesoft 
  we need core java knowledge
  
  
java got released in the year of 1995

 by jamesgosling and his team (14 members)
 
   he is the author 

from sunmicrosystem

   he releaed into three editions
   
   1.jse-java standard editions-core java
   
          we can develop standalone /desktop applications
		  
   2.jee-java enterprise editions-adv java
   
          we can develop enterprise/distributed applcations
		  using this we also can develop desktop applications
		  
		  
		  
   3.jme-java micro/mobile applications
   
         we can develop micro/mobile related applications 
		 
		   ex: android
		   
		   
if you are programmer

 -to devlop the software/application

 -we have to write the programs
 
prerequistes to write a java program?
````````````````````````````````````

c progam -> turbo c software -> 
cpp program -> turbo cpp software ->

java program -> jdk sofware 
  jdk -Java development kit
  
 1.download the jdk software
 2.install the software
 3.select the editor(notepade,notepad++,editplus,eclipse,myeclipse..)
 4.write the java program 
 5.save the java program (.java)
   note: extension always must be .java and that to 
   it must be in lower case letters.
 
 6.compile the java program 
 
 7.run/execute the java program 
 
 
 





from where we can download the jdk software?

 official website: www.oracle.com
 
 sunmicrosystem -organization 
 
 oracle purchase all copyrights of sunmicrosystem
 
 
  scjp ->sun certified  java programmer
  
  ocjp -> oracle certified java programmer
  
  
after software got installed how can we cross check whether it is 
installed suceesfuly or not?
 open command prompt 
 
 and pass the below command
 
 
 cmd:/>java -version
 
 java version "19.0.1" 2022-10-18
 Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 19.0.1+10-21)
 Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 19.0.1+10-21, mixed mode, sharing)
